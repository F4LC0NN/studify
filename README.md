This project is a simple and modern landing page with a form

For this project, I built a simple and modern landing page with a form.
Here are the subgoals:

- Create the basic HTML structure for the page and the form
- Use the elements to make as accessible as possible
- Use labels and legends to help the user
- Indicate clearly what fields are required
- Show the user if they entered the correct input
- Display a tooltip to guide the user in the process
- Make the design and structure easy to follow
- Make the page responsive
